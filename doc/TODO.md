## Known bugs
(aka unexpected behavior)

- Handler plugins may not work just yet (in progress switching to new system)
- If there is invalid data, things may currently crash, rather than give nice error messages.

## Current projects

- blogging plugin, which includes the plugin item (next in this list)
  TODO:
  + listing tag-plugin needs filtering, sorting, limiting. ("only 2012, in alpherbetical order, first 10")
  + archiving?  Say auto-generating each year (or months) listing pages?
- figuring out plugin hooks & best practices
  + move "sections" support to a plugin?
  + multi-line tag plugins?  again maybe with regex + HTMLParser? So multi-line regex
    it into tag_attributes + data, HTMLParser the tag_attributes, and then send the
    parsed attributes dict + data to the plugin function?

  + functions vs. classes... maybe it would actually be better to have all plugins
    as full classes rather than the simple ones being just functions?  Then the register
    function would raise the simple functions into the plugin class (or could be done
    with @decorators... but that would be less beautiful).
- more and better/consistant error handling and catching
- changing 'yuic' etc into java calls? is this a good idea?
  (so java -jar plugins/external/blah.jar) 
- documentation!!!

## Next

- caching / mtime & dependancies
- tags / categories, etc.
- blog "year/date/title" type of stuff
- auto-run on changes
- simple python httpserver thread ('dev server')
- bin/marlinespike.py should take some options for usual stuff (generate defaults, dev-server, auto, etc)
- jslint on json fail (part of error handling?)
- href="{{ _base_path }}blah" is very ugly.  Could there be an automatic
  base-path thing?  Either being very clever, and being truely automatic,
  or else (local:blah) or something?  That could actually get rid of needing
  'links' to .html files which are generated by .markdown files (which feels
  a bit odd).  You could just link to 'blah' and it would figure out if 'blah'
  is a directory, a generated .html, or whatever.
- context referencing? (Dunno what to call this) like in ConfigParser,
  "main":"/var/www","subfolder":"$main/sub" ?
  perhaps could be done context['subfolder'] = context['main'] + '/sub' (but that is kinda ugly)
  maybe a 'set' function does it automatically?  context.set('subfolder','$main/sub') or something.

## Would be nice

- GUI (osx, windows) / + .app distributable
- profiling, speeding up stuff
- django templates option
- post processing html minifer?
