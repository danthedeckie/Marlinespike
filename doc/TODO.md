## Known bugs
(aka unexpected behavior)

- If there is invalid data, things may currently crash, rather than give nice error messages.

## Current projects

- figuring out plugin hooks & best practices
  + move "sections" support to a plugin?
- plugins should be called with 'marlinespike_plugin(...)' rather than *stupid* execfile
  stuff in _config.py
- error handling and catching
- changing 'yuic' etc into java calls? is this a good idea?
  (so java -jar plugins/external/blah.jar) 
- documentation!!!

## Next

- caching / mtime & dependancies
- tags / categories, etc.
- blog "year/date/title" type of stuff
- auto-run on changes
- jslint on json fail (part of error handling?)
- yuic javascript/css minifier plugin
- href="{{ _base_path }}blah" is very ugly.  Could there be an automatic
  base-path thing?  Either being very clever, and being truely automatic,
  or else (local:blah) or something?  That could actually get rid of needing
  'links' to .html files which are generated by .markdown files (which feels
  a bit odd).  You could just link to 'blah' and it would figure out if 'blah'
  is a directory, a generated .html, or whatever.

## Would be nice

- GUI (osx, windows) / + .app distributable
- profiling, speeding up stuff
- django templates option
- post processing html minifer?
