## Known bugs
(aka unexpected behavior)

- If there is invalid data, things may currently crash, rather than give nice error messages.

## Current projects

- figuring out plugin hooks & best practices
  + move "sections" support to a plugin?
  + multi-line tag plugins?  again maybe with regex + HTMLParser? So multi-line regex
    it into tag_attributes + data, HTMLParser the tag_attributes, and then send the
    parsed attributes dict + data to the plugin function?

  + functions vs. classes... maybe it would actually be better to have all plugins
    as full classes rather than the simple ones being just functions?  Then the register
    function would raise the simple functions into the plugin class (or could be done
    with @decorators... but that would be less beautiful).
- plugins should be called with 'marlinespike_plugin(...)' rather than *stupid* execfile
  stuff in _config.py, or preferably from the config.json?
- error handling and catching
- changing 'yuic' etc into java calls? is this a good idea?
  (so java -jar plugins/external/blah.jar) 
- documentation!!!

## Next

- caching / mtime & dependancies
- tags / categories, etc.
- blog "year/date/title" type of stuff
- auto-run on changes
- jslint on json fail (part of error handling?)
- href="{{ _base_path }}blah" is very ugly.  Could there be an automatic
  base-path thing?  Either being very clever, and being truely automatic,
  or else (local:blah) or something?  That could actually get rid of needing
  'links' to .html files which are generated by .markdown files (which feels
  a bit odd).  You could just link to 'blah' and it would figure out if 'blah'
  is a directory, a generated .html, or whatever.

## Would be nice

- GUI (osx, windows) / + .app distributable
- profiling, speeding up stuff
- django templates option
- post processing html minifer?
