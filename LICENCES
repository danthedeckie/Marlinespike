Marlinespike (C)2012 Daniel Fairhead, Licence is GPL3.  Check COPYING for that.

Other projects are included (binary only) in

plugins/external/

(google's closure compiler, etc)

these are released under their own licences,
with their own copyright info which is in the appropriate folders.
Of course I'm not claiming authorship of them.  I just include them for
ease of use.
