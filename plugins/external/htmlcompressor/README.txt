Small, fast and very easy to use Java library that minifies given HTML or XML source by removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the content structure. As a result pages become smaller in size and load faster. A command-line version of the compressor is also available. 


USAGE:
	For java projects add htmlcompressor-1.5.3.jar library to your project's classpath
	For a command line usage run:
		java -jar htmlcompressor-1.5.3.jar -h
	to get a brief description of available parameters.
