# Marlinespike

A very simple _(but hopefully soon powerful)_ static site generator.

## Why the name?

Marlinespike is the art of ropework and general seaworthiness of sailors, 
named after the tool called a marlinespike, which essentially is a long pointy
stick which is used to seporate strands of rope, give extra purchase or grip
while hauling on some line or other, fighting off pirates, and generally 
anything else which you can think of for it.

## Why bother?

I have been using Jekyll - but I don't much like ruby, and prefer to keep
all our projects python rather than bring yet another language in to it.

Also, it's fun.

Also, Jekyll seems (to me) to be quite a bit complex beast, wheras I think this
ought to be a reasonably simple project.  Almost everything already exists as
libraries.

## Status:

Basics are working, most of our next generation site is working with this now,
still a lot of cleaning up and polishing needed before 'production ready'.
